The only problem is that the default text color is black. And as you might have figured out, black-on-black may not necessarily be a very visible color combination.</p> <p>So let's change our text to be rendered with the white color instead.</p> <p>The hex color code for a solid white color is <code>FFFFFF</code>, so we can add the following line to our text:</p> <p><code>.color(0xFFFFFF)</code> (<code>0x</code> is used to depict that the number is a hexadecimal number)</p> <p>So our text block should look something like this:</p> <pre><code>Text.create()\n.text(\"Hello World\")\n.color(0xFFFFFF)\n.draw(ctx);\n</code></pre> <p>Note that <code>.draw()</code> is the final command and you cannot append anything afterwards, so any setting must be appended before <code>.draw()</code>.</p> <p>Reload the resource pack again and we now see our text!</p> <p></p> <p>With this logic, we can append a second Text block to render a 2nd text as well:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>function render(ctx, state, pids) {\n    Text.create()\n    .text(\"Hello World\")\n    .color(0xFFFFFF)\n    .draw(ctx);\n\n    Text.create()\n    .text(\"Joban Client Mod v2!\")\n    .color(0xFFFFFF)\n    .draw(ctx);\n}\n</code></pre> <p> I mean it technically did render twice...</p> <p>But now they are overlapping and it's hard to see, let's move each of them apart. We can use the <code>.pos(x, y)</code> command to set the position of an element.</p> <p>By default, a text have a height of <code>9</code>, so we can append <code>.pos(0, 9)</code> to set the text position to 9 unit downwards:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>function render(ctx, state, pids) {\n    Text.create()\n    .text(\"Hello World\")\n    .color(0xFFFFFF)\n    .draw(ctx);\n\n    Text.create()\n    .text(\"Joban Client Mod v2!\")\n    .color(0xFFFFFF)\n    .pos(0, 9)\n    .draw(ctx);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Does the text look a bit weird?</p> <p>You may have noticed the <code>J</code> sticking out like a sore thumb, this is unfortunately due to Minecraft's imperfection when rendering TTF font. It will work fine if you switch to Minecraft font or with most other text combination</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"dev/scripting/type/pids/tut/pids_tut/#rendering-arrivals","title":"Rendering Arrivals","text":"<p>During the tutorial, you might have noticed the <code>pids</code> object in the create/render/dispose function. This represents our PIDS object, where we can obtain arrivals and more from there.</p> <p>We can get a list of arrivals with <code>pids.arrivals()</code>, and then obtain the n<sup>th</sup> arrival info with the <code>.get(n)</code> function.</p> <p>So to obtain the first arrival entry, we can do so like this:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>function render(ctx, state, pids) {\n    let firstRowArrival = pids.arrivals().get(0);\n    // ... rest of your code\n</code></pre> <p>Remember, JavaScript is 0-based index. The first number starts from 0, then 1, and so on and so fourth...</p> <p>Now that we have obtained our first arrival entry, we can obtain a variety of information with it, includeing it's route/LRT number, arrival and departure time, the route it's running and much more!</p> <p>You may refer to the PIDS Scripting Documentation for more information, but we will also cover some of it in this tutorial.</p> <p>At the moment we are only interested in getting the destination (Where the train is going). We can do that by calling the <code>destination()</code> function in our arrival entry:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>function render(ctx, state, pids) {\n    let firstRowArrival = pids.arrivals().get(0);\n    let firstRowDestination = firstRowArrival.destination(); // This is a string!\n    // ... rest of your code\n</code></pre> <p>And now we can replace our previous <code>Hello World</code> text content with <code>firstRowDestination</code>:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>function render(ctx, state, pids) {\n    let firstRowArrival = pids.arrivals().get(0);\n    let firstRowDestination = firstRowArrival.destination();\n\n    Text.create()\n    .text(firstRowDestination)\n    .color(0xFFFFFF)\n    .draw(ctx);\n\n    Text.create()\n    .text(\"Joban Client Mod v2!\")\n    .color(0xFFFFFF)\n    .pos(0, 9)\n    .draw(ctx);\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>However before we continue, we now have a bit of road block developing:</p> <ol> <li>We are obtaining the first arrival here, but what if we don't have a first arrival? What if there's no train running? What if the client is still fetching the arrival infos?</li> <li>Imagine a script filled with <code>Text.create()</code>, how would you be able to easily tell which text is which?</li> </ol> <p>Let's tackle the 2nd problem first. One way to do it is to add JavaScript comments with <code>//</code> or <code>/* */</code>. However JCM also reserved a slot for comment, and that is within the <code>Text.create(string)</code> function. So as an example, you can do the following:</p> <pre><code>Text.create(\"1st row destination\") // &lt;----\n.text(firstRowDestination)\n.color(0xFFFFFF)\n.pos(0, 0)\n.draw(ctx);\n</code></pre> <p>The \"1st row destination\" text (in the above example) is purely cosmetic, and you can write any string within that. As such, this could be served as a slot for commenting. Whether this is preferable depends on your personal preferences.</p> <p>Now back to the first problem, you may have already noticed some error popping up in your console log during some part of the tutorial. This is because we are trying to obtain a non-existent arrival.</p> <p>For that, we can add a null check to ensure that the arrival exists first:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>function render(ctx, state, pids) {\n    let firstRowArrival = pids.arrivals().get(0);\n    if(firstRowArrival != null) { // Check if arrival exists first\n        let firstRowDestination = firstRowArrival.destination();\n\n        Text.create(\"1st row destination\")\n        .text(firstRowDestination)\n        .color(0xFFFFFF)\n        .pos(0, 0)\n        .draw(ctx);\n    }\n    // ... rest of the text\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Great! However while this might be fine for rendering 1 line of arrival, in practice we often have to display much more than that. While we could just copy and paste these codes, they are error-prune and a mess to modify.</p> <p>Making matters more complicated, different PIDS Block have it's own number of arrival entry it supports. For example, RV PIDS supports 4 rows, while PIDS 1A only supports 3 rows.</p> <p>One solution is to change this to a for-loop. We can use <code>pids.rows</code> to obtain how many rows the current PIDS block supports:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>function render(ctx, state, pids) {\n    for(let i = 0; i &lt; pids.rows; i++) { // Set i to 0. i++ if i &lt; pids.rows, otherwise don't run this anymore\n        let arrival = pids.arrivals().get(i); // &lt;---- Obtain nth row arrival\n        if(arrival != null) {\n            Text.create(\"Arrival destination\")\n            .text(arrival.destination())\n            .color(0xFFFFFF)\n            .pos(0, i*9) // &lt;--- nth row * text height\n            .draw(ctx);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The runs everything within the for loop for however many rows the pids has, setting the <code>i</code> variable to the n<sup>th</sup> time our code is executed.</p> <p>As such, we can use <code>i</code> to determine our Y position as well as which arrival to obtain.</p> <p></p> <p>Of course, if your layout is not designed to be dynamic, and are designed for a specific PIDS, you can hardcode a number in (e.g. <code>4</code>) instead of <code>pids.rows</code>.</p>"},{"location":"dev/scripting/type/pids/tut/pids_tut/#text-size-language-cycle","title":"Text size &amp; Language Cycle","text":"<p>To resize a text, we can use the <code>.scale(factor)</code> function to scale the text to be larger or smaller.</p> <p>In our case, we will scale it by 1.25x:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>/// ... code before\nText.create(\"Arrival destination\")\n.text(arrival.destination())\n.color(0xFFFFFF)\n.pos(0, i*9)\n.scale(1.25) // Scale the text by 1.25x\n.draw(ctx);\n/// ... code after\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>The text does seems to be larger!

However the issue is that under the default text configuration, the text is left-aligned, and thus the x we give it is just the starting point of the text.</p> <p> Illustration of the issue we are facing</p> <p>To fix the issue, we need to right-align the text, to do that we can simply append <code>.rightAlign()</code> to our text:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nText.create(\"Arrival ETA\")\n.text(\"3 min\")\n.pos(pids.width, rowY)\n.scale(1.25)\n.rightAlign()\n.draw(ctx);\n// ... code after\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>The text margin is still not perfect, but it's just a matter of doing some subtraction, which we can do later.</p> <p>Now let's move on to functionality: As we have previously established, we can obtain the arrival's destination text with the <code>destination()</code> function.</p> <p>An arrival entry have more functions than that. For a full list you can check ArrivalEntries.</p> <p>For our purposes, we are going to use the <code>arrivalTime()</code> function. This returns the epoch time the train is arriving at (in millisecond), or in other word, how many millisecond (1/1000th of a second) have passed since 1 January 1970.</p> <p>This in of itself is not that useful, but we can use JavaScript's Date Object <code>Date.now()</code> to obtain the same thing, except referring to the time now. This also means we can use that to compare the time between now and the arrival time!</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nlet eta = arrival.arrivalTime() - Date.now(); // Difference between our estimated arrival time (future) and now\nText.create(\"Arrival ETA\")\n.text(eta) // Change the text to render our eta\n.pos(pids.width, rowY)\n// ... code after\n</code></pre> <p>Now you should see umm... big numbers rapidly counting down:</p> <p></p> <p>If you are lucky enough to have a train stopping during this (As seen above), you'll see that the number rolls to the negative. This is because the train have already arrived.</p> <p>So for example <code>-4721</code> here means that the train have already arrived for 4.721 second, while <code>43963</code> means that the train will arrive in 43.963 second, since the number is represented in millisecond (1/1000th of a second).</p> <p>As such, we can obtain the second remaining by dividing it by 1000:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nlet eta = (arrival.arrivalTime() - Date.now()) / 1000;\nText.create(\"Arrival ETA\")\n.text(eta)\n// ... code after\n</code></pre> <p> </p> <p>Now we just need to round the number to get a full integer:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nlet eta = Math.round((arrival.arrivalTime() - Date.now()) / 1000);\nText.create(\"Arrival ETA\")\n.text(eta)\n// ... code after\n</code></pre> <p>We could continue implementing like this, however I'll leave this as an exercise to the viewer after finish this tutorial :)</p> <p>Instead for now we can go the slightly lazy route: JCM have included a helper script by default, namely PIDSUtil, which have a function to automatically format ETA text.</p> <p>Here, we can use the <code>include()</code> function to import the PIDSUtil script:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>include(Resources.id(\"jsblock:scripts/pids_util.js\")); // Built-in script shipped with JCM\n// ... Rest of the script\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>We can only include scripts while JCM is parsing the script (i.e. Outside of function). It is not possible to put them in the <code>render</code> function for example, as by that time JCM has already finished parsing the entire script, and it's only calling your function.</p> <p>Now that we have imported the script, we can now use it's function, <code>PIDSUtil.getETAText(time: number)</code>:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nText.create(\"Arrival ETA\")\n.text(PIDSUtil.getETAText(arrival.arrivalTime()))\n.pos(pids.width, rowY)\n.scale(1.25)\n.rightAlign()\n.draw(ctx);\n// ... code after\n</code></pre> <p>After reloading, you should see that it returns a raw string without any language separation. However more importantly the unit is correct. (mins/sec)</p> <p></p> <p>And as we have learnt from handling the destination text, we can wrap it with <code>TextUtil.cycleString()</code>:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nText.create(\"Arrival ETA\")\n.text(TextUtil.cycleString(PIDSUtil.getETAText(arrival.arrivalTime())))\n// ... code after\n</code></pre> <p>And finally to not start a war, let's apply some spacing to both the destination and ETA text so it doesn't lean along the edge:</p> <p>pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nText.create(\"Arrival destination\")\n// ... code\n.pos(8, rowY)\n// ... code\n\nText.create(\"Arrival ETA\")\n// ... code\n.pos(pids.width - 8, rowY)\n// ... code after\n</code></pre> </p>"},{"location":"dev/scripting/type/pids/tut/pids_tut/#v2-light-rail-light-rail-everywhere","title":"v2: Light Rail, Light Rail Everywhere!","text":"<p>Now it's time to add the light rail route symbol.</p> <p>First, let's move our destination text to the right, 30 unit to be exact, so we can reserve some space for our light rail symbol on the left:</p> pids_tut.js<pre><code>// ... code before\nText.create(\"Arrival destination\")\n// ...\n.pos(30, rowY)\n// ... code after\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"dev/scripting/type/pids/tut/pids_tut/#drawing-the-light-rail-symbol","title":"Drawing the Light Rail Symbol","text":"<p>For reference, this is the symbol used for Hong Kong Light Rail Route:</p> <p> This is a replica render of the symbol, but should look close-enough</p> <p>It is consisted of a pill with white-background, followed by a thick route colored border, and a black border inside that.</p> <p>To understand how we should approach this, let's take a look at the resource file provided in the tutorial resource pack, under <code>assets/jsblock/textures/lrr.png</code>:</p> <p> The texture quality itself is... not the greatest, but let me be lazy while I can get away with it :P</p> <p>Essentially this is just the above version, but without the centered white part, and the route color being white.</p> <p>The reason why it's white is because we will be tinting the texture color to follow our route color.

No matter how you tint black, it's still black.</p> <p>As for the centered pill-shaped part, we have to draw it separately, as that part shall not be tinted with our route color.
