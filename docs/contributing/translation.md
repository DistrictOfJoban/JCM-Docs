We currently provide official translations for **English**, **Chinese Simplified (zh_cn)** and **Chinese Traditional (zh_tw, zh_hk)**.  
Other translations are not officially maintained, but you may contribute by forking this project, adding the necessary translation files and submit a pull request here.

## Categories

### Primary translations
**Primary translations** refers to translations that will appear with only Joban Client Mod (And it's dependencies, including MTR) installed. These are usually item and blocks translations, which is vital for the players.

### Secondary translations
**Secondary translations** refers to optional integration, these are usually mod integrations.

Currently JCM supports [Item Descriptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/item-descriptions), which adds additional translations string to describe the block/item.

As a contributor, you may work on either type of translations (or both!), however it is recommended to work on the primary translations first.

The English translation file (The most up-to-date) is located in `fabric/src/main/resources/assets/jsblock/lang/en_us.json`, you may use that as a base and translate it to other languages.  
Text does not have to be translated literally, as long as the original meaning are not lost.
