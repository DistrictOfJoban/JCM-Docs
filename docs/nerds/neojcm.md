# NeoJCM
NeoJCM is a derived version of Joban Client Mod v2 that integrates to a fork of NeoMTR's codebase, which in turn derives from Minecraft Transit Railway 3.0.

It is a part of [NeoMTR Pro Max](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban/NeoMTR) project *(Terrible naming but you get it!)*, which aims to port NeoMTR into a usable state for deployment in servers such as [The District of Joban](https://joban.org), as well as just a playground for me :)

While not the initial goal, the source code also serves as a pointer to a port of JCM to MTR 4.1, where the Minecraft-Mappings framework will no longer be used.
