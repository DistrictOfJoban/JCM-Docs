## Version Differences
Before installing, it is important to know that Joban Client Mod have 3 variants:

### v1 **Unsupported**{: .jcm-tag .unsupported }

This is the original Joban Client Mod, designed for **Minecraft Transit Railway 3** (MTR 3)

- Available for Minecraft Fabric/Forge **1.16.5 - 1.20.1**

### v2 **Supported**{: .jcm-tag .supported }

This is a rewritten version of Joban Client Mod, designed for **Minecraft Transit Railway 4** (MTR 4)

- Supports Minecraft Fabric/Forge **1.16.5 - 1.20.4**

### neo **Semi-supported**{: .jcm-tag .amber }

This is a variant of Joban Client Mod v2 that targets [NeoMTR](https://modrinth.com/mod/neomtr), a derived version of MTR 3.

- Available for Minecraft Fabric/NeoForge **1.21.1**

Currently we only support and continue releasing new versions for **v2**, and therefore only MTR 4 is supported.  
If you are new to the MTR mod/JCM, you are advised to start from **MTR 4** and **JCM v2**.
