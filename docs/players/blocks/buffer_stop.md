A **Buffer Stop** is a decoration block in Joban Client Mod, mimicking the [Buffer Stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_stop) seen in East Rail Line. This device is used to prevent train from overrunning in the real world.

## Usage
Place the block at least **2 blocks** in front of the final rail node.
