A **Departure Pole** is a block in Joban Client Mod, used in conjunction with [Butterfly Light](./butterfly_light.md) and [Departure Timer](./departure_timer.md).

## Usage
Placing the pole would result in it aligning to the edge of the block facing towards you.  
Then, you can place both the [Butterfly Light](./butterfly_light.md) and [Departure Timer](./departure_timer.md) in front of the pole, with the pole acting as a support.
