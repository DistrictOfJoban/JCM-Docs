A **Help Line** is a wall-attached block in Joban Client Mod acting as a machine to request assistance from station staff. This variant is seen in newer MTR Stations where the helpline sticker is separated from the helpline machine itself. 

## Usage
Right clicking the block would emit a redstone signal for 20 in-game ticks (or 1 second).
