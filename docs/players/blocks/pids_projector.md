A **PIDS Projector** is a transparent block that has the ability to project PIDS display with offset and rotation.

This block is a part of [JCM PIDS](../features/jcm-pids.md), which includes extra features such as PIDS Preset and more.

## Usage
1. Place this block down
1. 1. If near a platform, the PIDS will show the scheduled arrival for that platform.
1. 2. If away from any platform, you may manually specify platform(s) to show if the PIDS is located inside a MTR station.

For visualization purposes, holding the **Brush** item from the MTR mod allows you to see a red outline coming from the projector.

## Configuring
The PIDS can be configured by right clicking the block with the **Brush** item provided by the MTR mod.  
Additional options such as position offset, scale & rotation can be configured as well.
