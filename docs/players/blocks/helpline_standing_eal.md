A **Helpline (East Rail Line Type)** is a block in Joban Client Mod acting as a machine to request assistance from station staff. 

This replicates the help line seen in stations in the MTR East Rail Line.

## Usage
Right clicking the block would emit a redstone signal for 20 in-game ticks (or 1 second).
