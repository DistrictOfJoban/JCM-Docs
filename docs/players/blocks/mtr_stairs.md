A **MTR Stairs** is a decoration block in Joban Client Mod.

This block is a retextured Minecraft Stairs, for more detail please visit the [Stairs article](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Stairs) in the Minecraft Wiki.

## Known issues
Since the stair model is not modified, texture may not wrap properly as intended by Minecraft stairs.

The texture may look glitched when viewed from the side/making an "L" shape stair.
